web_page.py:

Description: This file, web_page.py, contains the class UltimateTicTacToeGame, which encapsulates the HTML template for a Tic Tac Toe game along with its styling. The HTML template dynamically generates the game board and related elements using Python's f-string formatting. Additionally, this file implements methods such as startPage, gamePage, and registerPage. The startPage method displays a welcome message to the game with a start button. The gamePage method returns the HTML template for displaying the game grid. The registerPage method presents a form for users to enter a username and password for registration. It was discussed and agreed with teammates that JavaScript would be used for the pages instead of Python, enhancing the interactivity and responsiveness of the user interface.

Purpose: The UltimateTicTacToeGame class facilitates the construction of the Tic Tac Toe game page by providing the necessary HTML structure and styling. The inclusion of methods such as startPage, gamePage, and registerPage enables the server to dynamically generate different pages based on user interactions, enhancing the user experience and interaction with the game.
