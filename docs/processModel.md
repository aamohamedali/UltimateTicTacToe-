# Development Process Model 

----
Throughout sprint 1 our team has implemented a process model as follows:
* Initial breakup of activities into modules for each team members contributions:
  * Tyler - User and Session Management implementation
  * Sam - Database module implementation 
  * Arshia - Server API implementation
  * Ashfaq - App Logic implementation
  * Shreyas - HTML Template and construction implementation
* Set up of kanban board for the tracking of each contributor's activity tasks.
* Use of issue tracker to outline any issues a contributor may have, requirements from another contributor needed, missing functionality, etc.
* Held in person team meetings during class time:
  * General discussion on the current status of each team member's module.
  * Any issues or potential issues that have or may arise.
  * Discussion with the professor for clarification on what is required from our project and any issues we could not resolve amongst the team.
  * Code reviews/pull requests merged during meetings.
  * Held 2 scheduled meetings with the professor.
  * meeting notes documented in MeetingNotes.md.
  * Scrum master and note taker rotated between meetings.
* Code Reviews:
  * All contributor branches of the project were put through a code review before merging into the main project branch.
  * Each review was done by following the checklist in the pr_checklist.md file. 
  * A general comment was provided on each code review detailing any prevailing minor issues or fixes required. 
  * If the issue was more than an update to documentation, a minor change to a unittest or a change to one line of code, the code was not merged.
* Performance reviews were conducted for each team member by each team member, ahead of the end of sprint 1, these are found in the docs\performanceReviews directory.
* Potential changes to our process in sprint 2:
  * Based off our experience of the process followed in sprint 1, and performance reviews from each team member, we may make some changes to our process going forward.
  * We may conduct our team meetings via discord for the most part in the future, meeting in person if we have a question or schedule a meeting with the professor.
  * This should help streamline our code reviews and pull request to avoid implementation bottlenecks, as well as team communication, something we struggled with in sprint 1.
